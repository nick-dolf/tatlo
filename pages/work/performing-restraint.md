info: "<p><em>Performing Restraint</em> is based on the idea of constraints, ownership,
  artistic ego, and labor.  </p><p>It is an 8-hour performance mimicking the structure
  of a typical 9a-5p job located in a generic construction site/office space. We wear
  the same outfit making us into one unit. We have a specific task every hour (creating
  marks on the wall, trading places, removing previous marks, etc.), while tied to
  each other (every hour the rope is shortened). We are not aloud to speak. Communication
  is only through physical interactions and altercations. </p><p>The idea is to create
  a micro-system where each of us is continuously working a laborious routine, without
  knowing the final outcome. At the same time, We do not have final authorship or
  specificity—each of our marks are layered on top of one another, with no one’s hand
  taking priority. Viewers are allowed to enter the space and interact. At the end
  of the performance we leave the space exactly how it is. What is left is the residue
  of the performance, the mark of our actions, and the visual product of our labor.</p>"
