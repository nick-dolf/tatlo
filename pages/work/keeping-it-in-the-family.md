title: " Keeping it in the Family"
info: |2-

  <p><em>Keeping it in the Family</em> is centered on the idea of family situations and abstracted through movements in a timeframe of 24 hours. We performed different tasks and situations non-stop for 24 hours in the two-level space at the Glasshouse. The whole day was divided into four sections: Family Feast (6p-1a), Family Everyday (1a-7a), Death (7a-9a), and Rebirth (9a-6p).</p>
  <p>We conflated our heritage, upbringing, gender, sexuality and obsessive impulses by stretching the limits of familial ties. Throughout the day one is enveloped in the messiness of being in a family as we create situations that are confrontational, intense, sexual, dismal, playful, banal, and, celebratory.</p>
