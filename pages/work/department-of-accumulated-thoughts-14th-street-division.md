  <p><em>The Department of Accumulated Thoughts</em> is a non-profit company that seeks to collect, archive, and share the mundane and extraordinary routines, thoughts, and details that structure various groups of people. Our goal is to accumulate and reflect back the unconscious and conscious thought patterns that weave through and interconnect populations. We are driven to build bridges between the private spheres of individual lives.</p>
  <p>For Art in Odd Places: NUMBER we were interested in taking a cross-section of Manhattan with 14th Street as our case study. This street is the longest in Manhattan and represents a diverse demographic. We interacted with the public by inviting them in our portable cubicle with a three-part survey. We started from the East Village and ended in the Hudson River for a span of 10 hours.</p>
  <p>Please click <a href="https://departmentofaccumulatedthou-blog.tumblr.com/">HERE</a> to see all the surveys.</p>
