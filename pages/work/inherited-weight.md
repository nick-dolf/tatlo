info: ' "The White Man''s Burden: The United States and the Philippine Islands"
  is a poem written in 1899 by British novelist Rudyard Kipling at the beginning of
  the Philippine-American War. In the poem, Kipling promotes the idea that the US
  should acquire colonies, just as other European nations. In this piece, we performed
  a poetic gesture of literally internalizing and embodying these words. The poem
  is printed on a long strip of fabric that we consumed, revealed through our mouths,
  and then wrapped our faces; binding us and making us blind and mute. Through this
  gesture, we are interested in the legacy of imperialism on the psyche and body,
  from generation to generation.'
