description: |2-

  We hauled an office desk on wheels during New Museum’s IdeasCity Streetfest for Art in Odd Places: NUMBER. We interacted and surveyed the public through a rigorous and absurdist method of data collecting for the Department of Accumulated Thoughts to record a particular time of day in the Bowery/LES location.
