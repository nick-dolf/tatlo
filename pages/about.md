Tatlo is a collaboration between [Sara Jimenez](http://sarajimenezstudio.com/ "Sara Jimenez") and [Jade Yumang](http://jadeyumang.com/ "Jade Yumang"). The two met at graduate school at Parsons the New School for Design in New York City and have been collaborating since 2012. Through performance, video, social interventions, and sculpture, Jimenez and Yumang explore how the body adapts or fails to certain strict criteria. Often their projects are framed through cultural expectations, personal experiences, systems of restraints, and bodily fatigue. Tatlo has performed and exhibited at BronxArtSpace, The Brooklyn Museum, Strange Loop Gallery, Art in Odd Places Festival, the Dedalus Foundation, and Anthology Film Archives. Jimenez lives and works in Brooklyn and Jade lives and works in Chicago. Both also have individual art practices based on sculpture and installation.

Sara was born in the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, Haudenosaunee, Attawandaron (Neutral),  and Wendat peoples of London, Ontario and raised in Bethesda, MD. She received her BA in Semiotics and Communication Theory from the University of Toronto with departmental honors in 2008 and an MFA at Parsons School of Design in 2013. She is a part-time faculty at Parsons School of Design.

Jade was born in Quezon City, Philippines, grew up in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, immigrated to unceded Coast Salish territories in Vancouver, BC, Canada, and currently lives in Chicago, IL, USA, which sits on the traditional unceded homelands of the Council of the Three Fires. Jade received an MFA at Parsons School of Design with Departmental Honors in 2012, and a BFA Honors from the University of British Columbia in 2008. Jade is the recipient of several grants from the Illinois Arts Council, Canada Council for the Arts, and British Columbia Arts Council, and is featured in the book Queer Threads: Crafting Identity and Community. Jade is an Associate Professor in the Department of Fiber and Material Studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

Tatlo is concerned with how the body adapts or fails to certain strict criteria through performance endurance, social interventions, and sculpture. Often times these are framed through cultural expectations, personal experiences, systems of restraints, and bodily fatigue.
