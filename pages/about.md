Tatlo is a collaboration between [Sara Jimenez](http://sarajimenezstudio.com/ "Sara Jimenez") and [Jade Yumang]( http://jadeyumang.com/ "Jade Yumang"). The two met in New York City  and started to make work together in 2012.

Sara was born in the traditional territory of the Anishinaabeg, Haudenosaunee, Attawandaron (Neutral),  and Wendat peoples of London, Ontario and raised in Bethesda, MD. She received her BA in Semiotics and Communication Theory from the University of Toronto with departmental honors in 2008 and an MFA at  Parsons School of Design in 2013. She is a part-time faculty at Parsons School of Design.

Jade was born in Quezon City, Philippines, grew up in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, immigrated to unceded Coast Salish territories in Vancouver, BC, Canada, and currently lives in Chicago, IL, USA, which sits on the traditional homelands of the people of the Council of Three Fires, the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa as well as the Menominee, Miami and Ho-Chunk nations. Jade received an MFA at Parsons School of Design with Departmental Honors in 2012, and a BFA Honors in University of British Columbia in 2008. Jade is the recipient of several grants from Canada Council for the Arts and British Columbia Arts Council, and is featured in the book Queer Threads: Crafting Identity and Community. Jade is an Assistant Professor in the department of Fiber and Material Studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

Tatlo is concerned with how the body adapts or fails to certain strict criteria through performance endurance, social interventions, and sculpture. Often times these are framed through cultural expectations, personal experiences, systems of restraints, and bodily fatigue.
